Documentation
=============

Documentation has the complete description of a Astropy package with all requisite details, including usage, dependencies, and examples.
Documentation is comprehensive reference material, possibly a little dry but both basic and high level.

See the `Astropy documentation <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/>`_ for a structured view of the functionality within the Astropy project.
